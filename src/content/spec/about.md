# About
This site is maintained by [Salman Chen](https://salmanhiro.github.io). Mainly will talk about mathematical sciences, as I like to refer mathematics and beyond as this kind of field and not to be confused with applied mathematics since I also like non-applied mathematics.

I am a graduate student in Astrophysics in National Tsing Hua University studying cosmology and high-performance computing, after previously working as machine learning and security engineer for years.
